        Akari the Testing Framework for optimizing and porting x86 Intrinsics to
        OpenPOWER
      </h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Intel x86-64 CPU are everywhere. From laptop PC to supercomputer.
          Intel x86-64 is CISC(Complex Instruction Set Computer) and very long
          history. And once code runs on Intel x86-64, it must run Intel
          forever. So Intel carries a lot of past heritage. On the other
          hand,IBM Power and ARM are RISC(Reduced Instruction Set Computer) and
          its same in the aspect of “it runs once, it must run forever” but
          instruction set are simple and RISC can use relatively new technology.
          So many supercomputer use RISC. But No 1 of market share of
          supercomputer is Intel because many Linux application is made for
          Intel. So if application for Intel x86-64 can run RISC like ARM or
          OpenPOWER by very optimized way. It’s great advancement of Computer
          Science and Technology. There are many SIMD Intel x86 intrinsic
          function.Intel intrinsic function runs only on Intel,not on OpenPOWER
          Systems.So we need to port Intel x86 intrinsic code to OpenPOWER
          equivalent code to run application by good performance on OpenPOWER
          Systems.But porting Intel x86 Intrinsics to OpenPOWER Intrinsics is
          technically challenging.
        </p>

        <p>
          Intrinsic functions is a way to directly access SIMD instructions from
          high level language like C. Intrinsic functions are specific to CPU
          architecture. Intel has specific intrinsic function and OpenPOWER and
          ARM has. And Intel intrinsic function are not 1 to 1 correspondence to
          other RISC intrinsic function. So porting is needed. porting has
          unique wrapping structure like below.
        </p>
<pre><code>
extern __inline __m128d __attribute__((__gnu_inline__,__always_inline__,__artificial__))
_mm_add_pd (__m128d __A, __m128d __B)
{
  return (__m128d) ((__v2df)__A + (__v2df)__B);
}
</code></pre>
        <div>
          <p>
            Porting seems easy but one problem exist. Is behavior same? Need
            validating correctness of porting. But we cannot make sure porting
            is correct by gazing source code. Way to validate source code of
            porting is- for example source code shown above- Input random value
            to __A and __B to Intel intrinsic function and that of ported to
            OpenPOWER or other RISC architecture.And get return value from these
            function and make sure return value is same between Intel intrinsic
            functions and that of ported to other RISC.To make this testing
            framework. We have to mutually connect Intel and OpenPOWER or other
            RISC on the cloud computer by internet or other computer network.
